# Model-free video game personalization for educational serios games

This project applies reinforcement learning in order to dynamically modify a serious game environment to help the player achieve a certain learning objective. This project has grown closely with our case study of an [archaeological educational serious game](http://www.iiia.csic.es/draga/downloads.html) based in [la Draga](http://www.iiia.csic.es/draga/)

## Implemented tricks and techniques

> - Irace
> - Q-Learning
> - K-Means clustering
> - Player simulation
> - State and action space discretization

## Implemented visualization functionalities

> - HTLM
> - Q-Matrix heatmap visualization
